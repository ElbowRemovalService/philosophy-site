                <p>Philosophy often gets a bad wrap in common circles. Many people tend to dismiss philosophy as
                    useless, or
                    as irrelevant quibbling about what really is. It is often equated with groups like hippies,
                    constantly
                    high, never serious, and never practical. This is an unfair and shortsided perspective to hold on
                    the
                    topic. Philosophy is not merely two old men in a room thinking about metaphysics (although that
                    certainly counts). Rather, <b>philosophy is the love of knowledge, or the pursuit of wisdom</b>.
                    This
                    pursuit extends into every part of reality. </p>

                <p>Philosophy has many subsections and many individual areas of study. There are five primary fields of
                    philosophy.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Metaphysics</b>, or questions about reality and existence itself. The most famous quote about
                        metaphysics is Rene Descartes' "I think, therefore I am" ( or "cogito, ergo sum" in Latin), in
                        which he proved that his mind must exist. This area of philosophy is what most often gets a bad
                        wrap from outsiders. After all, it seems purely ridiculous to assume that we don't exist. As has
                        been said, "Once you sweep everything off the table, it becomes difficult to put it back on." We
                        shall leave metaphysics behind for the moment.</li>
                    <li><b>Epistemology</b>, or questions about knowledge. There are four primary positions on
                        epistemology: rationalism, empiricism, relativism, and skepticism. Rationalism states that
                        reason is the method through which knowledge can be gained. By contrast, empiricism states that
                        knowledge can only be gained by experimentation and observation. The two butt heads frequently
                        in their most extreme states, but some degree of synthesis is possible between them. Anyone may
                        attempt to incorporate some degree of rationalism in their empiricism and visa versa. The final
                        two positions, however, are more contentious. Skepticism is the epistemological claim that some
                        or all knowledge is impossible to gain. Relativism is the claim that knowledge is subjective or
                        relative, and changes from person to person or culture to culture.</li>
                    <li><b>Ethics</b>, or questions about how man should act. Inside of this category of ethics is
                        morality as well, sometimes considered to be a synonym of ethics, while othertimes considered a
                        subsection of it. This is the most contentious area of philosophy by far, among both
                        philosophers and the average man. There are far more ethics and disputes of ethics here that
                        shall be partially addressed elsewhere.</li>
                    <li><b>Logic</b>, or principles of reasoning, is one of the least contentious areas of study. Quite
                        typically, only those who are concerned with metaphysics or certain parts of epistemology have
                        disputes with this area, as the laws of logic are relatively universally accepted.</li>
                    <li><b>Aesthetics</b>, or questions about beauty, is, in my opinion, by far the most boring kind of
                        philosophy. The majority of aesthetic discussion is relevant only for niche sections of
                        epistemology or metaphysics or results in mostly subjective statements about what makes
                        something look good that, while certainly useful for architects and interior designers, is not
                        so useful for those of us in more grounded fields. </li>
