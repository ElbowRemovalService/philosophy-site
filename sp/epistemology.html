                <br>Objectivism: The philosophy that reality is objective, being independent of the thoughts and
                philosophies of man. This is metaphysical objectivism, not the Objectivism of Ayn Rand, which is
                certainly is metaphysically objective, but also contains additional claims.

            <h4>Skepticism</h4>
            <p>Skepticism we can discount immediately. Total skepticism makes the objective claim that objective
                knowledge is impossible, thus contradicting, for to know that objective knowledge is impossible requires
                the objective knowledge that objective knowledge is impossible, of which said knowledge is, supposedly,
                impossible to know. Thus, even when assumed to be correct, total skepticism is in necessary
                contradiction, and is thus, with no uncertainty, false.<br>
                Partial skepticism, or the claim that some knowledge is unknowable, is entirely useless, as it must
                determine first what cannot be known. Any claim that Proposition X is unknowable requires knowledge of
                Proposition Y, which states that P(X) is unknowable. To know P(Y), it must be known that P(Y) is
                knowable, thus either requiring Proposition Z or being a self-determining fact, such as an a priori
                claim. All of this would then logically boil down to the claim that there are things which we do not
                know. The position that there are things unknown is a position in no wise antithetical to any other
                position, for objectivism nor relativism mandate that man have complete knowledge (and thus
                omniscience). They are statements about reality, not man's perception of it. Partial skepticism falls
                even further when it is noted that man may claim to know something he does not. The skeptic must reply,
                "You cannot know!" But how can this claim be defended? For it must be known that this cannot be known,
                and it must be proven that this cannot be known. Any such argument will almost certainly be fallacious,
                for if the claimed knowledge is impossible by contradiction, we do not have a case of unknowable
                knowledge but of something which cannot exist, which would not be knowledge. One cannot have knowledge
                of the earth being flat, for knowledge, philosophically speaking, is true justified belief. The earth,
                being a spherical shape, cannot be known to be flat, for that is not true. Without proof of
                contradiction, an infinite regress of Propositions is necessary, and thus contradictory, for a
                necessarily infinite number of things must be known, all merely to know that something can't be known.
                If the claim that Information A was unknowable was true, it could be shown that there is insufficient
                truth or justification behind the belief in Information A. If the claim was made that any who read this
                were born on April the 9th in the year 2002, it would be found specious on grounds of truth and
                justification. Much greater justification could be made for the claim that all who read this are male;
                but even so, insufficient justification can be made; speculation, however probable, is definitely
                required.<br>
                All forms of skepticism are necessarily useless. Total skepticism, having been curtailed from
                questioning the individuals' own existence (cogito ergo sum) must then state that we cannot know whether
                anything besides our own mind exists. This claim is necessarily false by means of having to know that we
                cannot know if only our mind exists (yet another infinite loop of Preposition A¹, B¹... Zⁿ). Thus, we
                conclude our analysis of skepticism in the harsh negative.

            <h4>Absurdism</h4>
            <p>Absurdism has two seperate philosphies under the same name. The first is the theory that the universe's
                perceived irrationality and meaninglessness lies in contention with an inherent human desire for
                meaning. The second is a subset of skepticism which merely claims that we cannot understand the
                universe. This second definition is itself absurd, for claiming that we cannot understand the universe
                requires the ability to have understood that we cannot understand the universe. This second definition
                shall be disgarded for the remainder of this work.
                Absurdism is irrelevant in a debate about epistemology. The truth of a matter is not the meaning of a
                matter. Whether or not the universe has meaning is of no matter to whether or not water boils at 373
                degrees Kelvin or not. The presence of this philosophy in this dissertation is unfortunate, but required
                due to ill-founded complaints from some who have read earlier drafts of this work.

            <h4>Relativism</h4>
            <p>Relativism claims that what is true varies from person to person, or culture to culture. If, then, any
                individual or culture holds that relativism is false, according to relativism, this is true. Thus, as
                this person or culture holds a perspective that relativism is false for everyone else, relativism must
                assume itself incorrect by the mere existence of the claim that it is incorrect. It cannot be true and
                false at the same time, for that would be to assert that A = A but that A =/= A, violating the law of
                noncontradiction. Furthermore, assuming relativism brings no reasons to care for others' "truth," for it
                is not true for you if you so decide. Any argument as to why it should be can be discounted by the mere
                act of deciding otherwise. Additionally, if relativism allows for internal contradiction from person to
                person's "truth," there is no need for consistency and one may declare himself right in all
                circumstances bar none.<br>
                The logical conclusion of individual relativism is that, seeing a man engaged in the act of rape, can be
                "moral" or "just" because he says so, and "immoral" and "unjust" because the violated says so. There can
                be no reconciliation of justice for this abomination, for our options are that either that the man can
                be punished for wrongdoing despite having done no wrong, or that the man cannot be punished regardless
                of wrong done. To establish individual relativism is to destroy morality. As for knowledge itself, were
                relativism to be correct, the man would be able to say that he had not raped the victim at all, and the
                victim could insist that he has in fact been raped, and both would have to be true. Individual
                relativism on any grounds is foolish. There is no purpose in pointing out, even were it to be assumed
                true, that something is "my truth," for, if relativism is true, that "truth" would not be the "truth" of
                anyone that has disagreed, nor can sharing it change another's "truth" regardless of any evidence of
                contradiction in their own "truth" due to the relativistic assumption that any individual may declare it
                not so.<br>
                Cultural relativism is even more flawed, falling to all the same issues listed above, but additionally
                falling to the problem of having to determine what a culture is. Is the state of Germany a culture?
                Thus, was the Holocaust moral for Germans? Would it be immoral if the gas chamber extended twenty
                centimeters into France, and the treatment an unlucky Jew who fell against that wall would become
                immoral while the equal treatment to his family and friends would remain morally good? Any inspection of
                cultural relativism must conclude that it is merely a claim that Might makes Right. Suppose a "culture"
                on an island, containing nought but two men and a woman. According to cultural relativism, the two men
                may do as they please with the women, killing and raping (in any order), and have that behaviour be
                moral; however, if but two objecting others are added, this action becomes immoral. However, as long as
                the settlements of the two others are far enough away, suddenly, this horrid action becomes yet again
                moral! This Schrödinger's morality is so clearly ridiculous as to make anyone wonder how it can be
                justified.<br>
                As the final nail in the relativist coffin, the mere act of arguing is an appeal to reason and evidence.
                One cannot appeal to reason or evidence unless those things are objective and universally valid; thus,
                the existence of reason disproves relativism. If one disagrees with this statement, they must call the
                reasoning invalid, and thus presume that reason is valid or invalid on an objective level. Beyond even
                this, language itself necessitates a common and objective ground. Were there not objective truth, all
                the argument I have presented above could to another be an excellent recipe for homemade rolls.<br>
                <b>Rolls</b><br>
                2 cups milk (powdered works great)<br>
                1 cup mashed potatoes<br>
                ½ cup butter<br>
                2 tablespoons yeast<br>
                ⅓ cup sugar<br>
                2 eggs, beaten<br>
                1 teaspoon salt<br>
                <br>
                Mix. Add 7-7½ cups flour. Cover for three hours. Roll out. Dip in melted butter. Let raise until
                doubled. Bake at 350° for 20-22 minutes.<br>
                <br>
                If the text this sentence immediately follows does not seem to you a logical continuation of the
                argument above, you have observed
                astutely. This simple fact is further proof of the argument above it.

            <h4>Post Scriptum Moralis</h4>
            <p>Having exhausted our (current) list of options other than objectivism, we are forced to accept it if no
                contradiction can be found. Fortunately, no such contradiction can be found, and the intuition agrees.
                <br>
                Morality, too, must be objective. If morality is relative, no man can claim to be or not be wronged, for
                it was not wrong of him who wronged him as long as the offender decided that his action was just. Any
                man claiming morality to be relative must then accept that any man who chooses to murder him can be
                just, regardless of any circumstances surrounding. Any man must then be willing to accept any action on
                behalf of another man, for it was not unjust of that man to act. Thus, the only acceptable claims are as
                follows: either morality is objective, or morality does not exist (which may be referred to as egoism).
