    <h1>A Brief Defense of Altruism</h1>
    <main>
        <div class="minichonker">
            <p>Altruism has rather famously been attacked by Ayn Rand, founder of Objectivism (a philosophy I tend to
                refer to as Randianism or Randian Objectivism to avoid confusion with metaphysical and epistemological
                objectivism). To establish her case against altruism, we must look to her own words.
                <br><br><span class="quote">What is the moral code of altruism? The basic principle of altruism is that man has no right to exist
                for his own sake, that service to others is the only justification of his existence, and that
                self-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue and value.</span><br><br>

                Thus, we have her first argument: that altruism dictates that the existence of man is only justified if
                that man serves others.<br><br>

                <span class="quote">Do not confuse altruism with kindness, good will or respect for the rights of others. These are not
                primaries, but consequences, which, in fact, altruism makes impossible. The irreducible primary of
                altruism, the basic absolute, is self-sacrifice—which means; self-immolation, self-abnegation,
                self-denial, self-destruction—which means: the self as a standard of evil, the selfless as a standard of
                the good.</span><br><br>

                Thus, the second argument: that altruism, being an ideology in which man sacrifices for others, cannot
                allow kindness or respect, and is necessarily a self-destructive ideology.<br><br>

                <span class="quote">Do not hide behind such superficialities as whether you should or should not give a dime to a beggar.
                That is not the issue. The issue is whether you do or do not have the right to exist without giving him
                that dime.</span><br><br>

                We see hear the crux of Rand's critique: she argues that, as the issue is “whether you do or do not have
                the right to exist without giving him that dime,” that altruism necessitates that your own right to
                existence depends upon giving the hypothetical beggar the hypothetical dime.<br><br>
                To give a final quote from Rand:<br>

                <span class="quote">Altruism declares that any action taken for the benefit of others is good, and any action taken for
                one's own benefit is evil. Thus the beneficiary of an action is the only criterion of moral value—and so
                long as that beneficiary is anybody other than oneself, anything goes.</span><br><br>

                We see that Rand has declared that altruism is an ideology which states that only actions which benefit
                others can be good, and any action which benefits yourself is evil.<br><br>

                Having now established several of Rand's criticisms, we shall now examine them.<br>
                Firstly, we inspect the claim that under altruism, man has no right to exist if he does not act to
                assist others. Unfortunately for Rand, here we find that she has been attacking a strawman. An infant
                child cannot exist without being helped - nor can our hypothetical beggar survive without his
                hypothetical dime - and many other examples. Would altruism claim that our beggar is evil for having
                received aid, or our infant immoral for having been raised? Such a claim is eminently ridiculous. A
                philosophy built upon acting to benefit others necessitates that others must be willing to accept
                actions which benefit them. Our beggar, then, has acted entirely in his own self-interest by accepting
                the coin. Altruism, then, requires that some act in their own self-interest at least some of the time.
                The claim, then, that altruism requires total destruction of the self is self-evidently false.
                <br>Further analyzing Rand's claim about altruism's requirements on existence, we discover that altruism,
                which according to Oxford may be defined as “the belief in or practice of disinterested and selfless
                concern for the well-being of others,” does not state that one ought to exist only if they help others.
                It is self-evident that man exists, and in altruism, we do not find a claim that man should exist only
                while assisting others; instead, we find the claim that to assist others is a moral good. Additionally,
                we do not find the claim that the only moral good is helping others, only that to help another is a
                moral good. As the title suggests, I am a proponent of altruism as I understand it. One could well argue
                that what I propose is not altruism, but a variant. I would agree that perhaps my understanding of
                altruism is separate from others, but I do not think myself departed from the umbrella of altruism.<br>

                <br>Now, we must examine Rand's second claim: that altruism is necessarily self-destructive and cannot allow
                for kindness nor respect. Altruism would be self-destructive if it dictated that all action must
                necessarily be both in the self-interest of others and exclusionary to the self-interest of one's self.
                This is eminently not the case. As Rand herself argued (correctly), it is quite possible to benefit
                others by acting in your own self-interest, as our capitalistic system, when not interfered with, does
                so. By equal measure, it is then possible to do the inverse, and benefit one's self by acting to benefit
                others. However, as stated previously, altruism does not dictate that the only acceptable action is one
                which benefits another; neither does it state that any action which benefits oneself is not acceptable.
                Altruism is then not systematically and necessarily self-destructive. This is not to say that it cannot
                be self-destructive; one could very easily give everything they have and thus ensure their own homeless
                demise (assuming none would assist them as they assisted others, of course, and further assuming that
                they would not foolishly give away that which they have just been given in similar vein), but by no
                means is this a necessary aspect of altruism. It is apparent that one cannot help others if one cannot
                help themselves. It is incoherent, then, for a proponent of altruism to claim that altruism necessitates
                total self-sacrifice, and equally incoherent for an enemy of altruism to declare it so.
                <br>The failures of Rand's critique of altruism (or perhaps more fairly, altruism as I understand and defend
                it) seem to boil down to a critique of the claim that “the only good is acting against your own
                self-interest and in the interest of another” rather than attacking the claim that “to act in concern
                for the well-being of another is a moral good.” However, even Rand herself admitted later in her life
                that it was not evil to help another. To return to our hypothetical beggar, Randians must answer the
                question: is it evil to give the dime to the beggar? If the answer is no, it must be posited; why? If
                our followup is answered in some variety of “Because you are acting in your self-interest,” the Randian
                must give up any and all critique of voluntary altruism. Returning to the original question, if the
                answer is yes, it is evil to give the dime to the beggar, once again, our followup is why? If the answer
                is “Because that is an action for the well-being of another,” could not then this criticism be used
                against capitalism, or even just trade in general? It would seem that the critique of altruism boils
                down to a claim that because one does not receive materialistic compensation for one's actions that
                one's actions are evil.<br>

                <br>To address a final statement of Rand's on altruism, as all previous ones are, in my opinion,
                satisfactorily addressed, we turn to Rand's statement on “forced altruism.” She stated that communism
                was enforced altruism, and used this as an argument against altruism. This statement, of all her
                critiques, is, in my opinion, the most fallacious. Altruism is necessarily voluntary. If one is forced
                to give up their substance for another's benefit, they have not chosen to act out of a concern for
                another's well-being. If one has been robbed, this does not make one an altruist. Altruism does not
                dictate that each man has a right to the substance of those more fortunate, only that it is good for the
                more fortunate to use their substance to help the less fortunate, presuming of course that no other
                principle would make this action immoral. Altruism necessitates that the individual has the freedom to
                act, and further requires property rights in order for one to use their own substance for another's
                benefit. In order for one to consistently support altruism, they must also support individualism and
                property rights.

                In conclusion, Rand's arguments against altruism fall completely flat. The entity which she calls
                altruism is surely contradictory, but altruism it is not.
