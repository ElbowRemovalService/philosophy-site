                <p>As an immediate point of clarification, knowledge is defined philosophically as true justified
                    belief. Thus, statements about knowledge are also to some degree statements about what is true, as
                    most philosophers were more interested in that modifier than in the justification or the belief. We
                    must choose from empiricism, rationalism, relativism, and skepticism. In order to know which is
                    right, we shall first employ a process of elimination. Let us examine each of our four primary
                    schools of thought and their variations. </p>

            <div class="space"></div>
            <div class="minichonker">
                <h4>Skepticism</h4>
                <p>Skepticism is the position which states that some or all knowledge is unknowable. Firstly, let us
                    examine extreme or total skepticism. Total skepticism would state that all knowledge is unknowable,
                    although the truth may exist. This position is immediately contradictory, as the knowledge that all
                    knowledge is unknowable is knowledge that, if the position were true, ought to be unknowable. Thus
                    is revealed a performative contradiction, or an internal contradiction that must be true and false
                    at once. However, as the law of noncontradiction must be true (A = A. B = B. A =/= B. Thus, A cannot
                    = B), the claim is necessarily false. The total skeptic may backpedal and say that all other
                    knowledge is unknowable, but they can make no distinction as to why that knowledge is itself
                    knowable, for not only can no reason exist, but were they to provide one, that reason would
                    encompass knowledge, which should be unknowable. This process continues until the total skeptic must
                    admit defeat, being forced to take instead the position that only some knowledge is unknowable. This
                    position, however, fails to distinguish them from any other position, as no rationalist nor
                    empiricist will argue the claim that man cannot know everything, for man is not omniscient.
                    Skepticism, then, is clearly not a position worth taking.</p>

            <div class="space"></div>
            <div class="minichonker">
                <h4>Relativism</h4>
                <p>Relativism would state that knowledge or the truth is relative, or variable between person to person
                    or culture to culture. Extreme relativism would state that all aspects of reality are variable to
                    the perception of an individual. This position would hold that, were I to decide that 2 + 2 = 5, it
                    would suddenly become so. This position is obviously false, for were it true, any individual could
                    believe that this position is false. This would require relativism to be both true and false,
                    violating the law of noncontradiction. Individual relativism, then, must necessarily fall short.
                    Cultural relativism would state that what is true is dependent from culture to culture. This stance
                    typically only arrives in moral spheres. This stance has the same flaw as before. If any culture
                    decides relativism is false, relativism breaks the law of noncontradiction. An additional flaw,
                    however, becomes apparent. What is a culture? What is a society? If a culture is merely a majority
                    of people, in what sphere do we denote a majority? A majority of all people living? Of all that have
                    lived? Of all living in a certain area? How do we denote to which area counts? Is an island with
                    three people a culture? If two of the three decide to murder the third, is that morally acceptable
                    because they are the culture? Thus we see that relativism fails on all counts.</p>

            <div class="minichonker">
                <h4>Empiricism</h4>
                <p>Empiricism would claim that knowledge comes from observation and experimentation <em>alone</em>. This
                    claim also seems to fall flat when it is considered that if reason does not determine knowledge,
                    than how can observing something allow one to conclude anything? In reality, it is inductive
                    reasoning which allows observation to have any power. As it turns out, there have been no
                    statistically valid studies (peer-reviewed, blinded, and controlled) proving that parachutes work to
                    prevent people from falling to their death. It is empirically invalid to claim, then, that
                    parachutes function. However, this is patently ridiculous, as skydiving is quite clearly something
                    done and survived. Thus, empiricism is lacking, if not totally decrepit like the previous two
                    entries into this list. Empiricism would qualify as part of the philosophy of objectivism (lower
                    case "o"), which states that the world is objective and real, and not subject to human thinking as
                    to how the laws of nature functions. </p>

            <div class="minichonker">
                <h4>Rationalism</h4>
                <p>Rationalism remains the final option, and, in my opinion, the best option. Rationalism is also the
                    most common sense option. Rationalism would claim that knowledge is acquired by the mind using
                    reason to determine fact. This can occur after observation or experimentation as well as from pure
                    reason itself. For example, an a priori (pure reason) rationalistic claim would be one that "One
                    cannot argue that one cannot argue." If someone argues that they can argue that they can't argue,
                    they are arguing, and thus engaged in a performative contradiction. Hence, the statement about
                    argumentation is objectively true by nature of it being impossible for it to be false. Thus,
                    rationalism alone fully passes our internal tests. Rationalism is also objectivist, and arguably
                    more so than empiricism. </p>
