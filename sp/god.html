            <p><b>Personal Experience</b><br>
                First, I shall immediately address the elephant in the room: personal experience. This is a stumbling
                block in the conversation. Suppose I claim to have seen an angel, but you say that angels cannot exist.
                If what I say is true, your statement must be false. If what you say is true, what I say must be false.
                What is difficult is determining who is right. If your argument that angels do not exist is predicated
                upon the claim that there is no evidence for them, your statement is patently false, for there is
                evidence, and that evidence is, at the least, my word. It must be stated immediately that personal
                experience is personal (duh) and near impossible to disprove or prove. My own experiences cannot truly,
                if at all, persuade you. As for the validity of my own experiences, they are determined by worldview. As
                an example, JP has said that he had spiritual experiences while he was religious. After leaving
                religion, he decided that he had been "faking" those experiences. This may be true. But I suspect that
                if he were never to have left, or were to rejoin, he may believe those experiences to have been real,
                and his conviction of their falsehood a product of his disbelief. I believe this is nearly always so. We
                as humans decide retroactively if our experiences were evidence, and often we decide in favor of
                supporting our current status quo.<br>
                If one does have a personal experience and chooses to believe it, there are fewer reasons better to
                believe in a God. The question would arise then what can be and should be concluded from such an
                experience, but that is a question for a different time.<br>
                I shall now move on to various arguments that have been given for the existence of God.<br><br>

                <b>Aquinas' First Cause Argument</b><br>
                This argument quite simply argues that the causal chain of events necessitates either infinite
                regression or an initial cause. The argument holds that infinite regression is not possible, and that
                thus, an initial cause that is either uncaused or self-causing has begun existence, and that this
                initial actor is God. This argument is flawed, I believe, argumentatively, in ways irrelevant to its
                truth. The primary argumentative flaw arises from definition. The argument that the universe could not
                have caused itself and thus was caused by something that did begs the question of why one thing could
                cause itself but the other could not. In argumentative fashion, one can simply define the universe as
                that which caused itself.<br>
                I conclude that it is impossible for man to understand how the universe could begin; and conversely, how
                it could not. Man cannot even understand a million; how then should we understand infinite regress or
                the supernatural? Similarly is it with the end. I cannot fathom how the universe could end, nor can I
                fathom how it could continue indefinitely. The beginning and the end are beyond my comprehension. The
                First Cause argument, then, I find to be, even if true, difficult to argue. If you find it persuasive, I
                do not fault you. It is an argument which appeals to something entirely beyond you or I. If you find it
                unpersuasive, I do not fault you. It is an argument which appeals to something entirely beyond you or I.
                It is a pointer argument; one which indicates an answer but does not find it.<br><br>

                <b>Aquinas' Argument from Motion</b><br>
                This argument is again simple. Objects in motion remain in motion unless acted upon by an outside force.
                An object that is not in motion cannot gain motion unless acted upon by an outside force. We see objects
                in motion, having acted upon each other. An outside force had to have initiated motion. No force in the
                universe could have initiated motion in the universe, for it would have to have had motion/energy to
                initiate motion. Thus, something outside the universe initiated the motion of the universe. This
                argument is essentially a variation of First Cause, but I find it a bit more persuasive. Some have
                argued that multiverse theory would disprove this argument, but that is not so, for that merely kicks
                the can down the road to motion in the next universe, and the next, and the next. It would then conclude
                that something outside the multiverse must have acted upon the multiverse.<br>
                Unfortunately, this argument is still suspect to the flaws of First Cause. This is another pointer
                argument. As a note, pointer arguments are not false arguments. They are not wrong. They merely do not
                prove the conclusion sought by the person making them. It is common that pointer arguments are evidence
                for the supernatural, but not definitive evidence for traits of that entity.<br><br>

                <b>The Kalam Cosmological Argument</b><br>
                Most famously put forward by William Lane Craig, the argument is simple. P1. That which began to exist
                has a cause. P2. The universe began to exist. Thus, P3, the Universe has a cause. There is much debate
                over this point, undermining significantly the apparaent simplicity. Suffice it to say that my own
                research on this argument has pointed me to believe that
                indeed, the universe *likely* began to exist, but once again, I believe this argument falls into the
                same category as First Cause; the category beyond human understanding. I can see reasons to accept or
                decline this argument. This is another pointer argument.<br>
                The astute observer will note that I spent nearly no time on this argument, being as it is the trademark
                argument of William Lane Craig, and being an argument notorious for requiring complex and convoluted
                discussion of infinity. The reasoning that I have so willingly left this ground I normally enjoy is
                simple: I believe that the argument is correct in how it presents infinity, how it confirms that the
                universe must have a cause, but I also believe that this argument once again points a clear hole in
                human understanding. Just as with the First Cause argument and the Argument from Motion, it shows a
                contradiction in human understanding. However, it is a jump from the correct observation that there is
                something we do not properly understand and may be incapable of understanding to the position that God
                exists. I do think the existence of God would answer the issues in these holes, but I do not think that
                it follows entirely to argue that because there is a hole in human knowledge, and because there is a
                potential answer to this hole, that one must accept the current only or best hypothesis. I do think it
                is logical to hold to the current or best hypothesis, but I don't believe you are logically inconsistent
                by not holding that hypothesis without additional data. As these arguments point out contradictions, it
                is quite reasonable to presume that there is not a contradiction, for reality cannot contradict itself,
                and that further time may allow for a discovery or breakthrough to reconcile these things. The answer,
                “I don't know,” is a perfectly acceptable response here.<br><br>

                <b>Aquinas' Necessary Being Argument</b><br>
                This argument states that the things in the world are contingent; contingent beings/things cannot exist
                without a cause or without something that they can rely on in order to exist. Thus, a necessary being
                must exist.<br>
                I must confess, I am rather unfamiliar with this argument. It seems to me that this argument must
                endeavor to prove what is contingent. It is clear that biochemistry is contingent upon chemistry. The
                existence of my body is contingent upon the existence of my parents. As Aquinas did not present these as
                complete arguments, but as examples of arguments, it is unsurprising that the argument lacks evidence
                and significance to prove itself. He did not present reasons as to why a necessary being must exist, so
                we cannot particularly prove or disprove this argument. If there must be a necessary being, there is
                one. This is true. Never was it argued whether there must be a necessary being.<br><br>

                <b>Aquinas' Argument from Degrees</b><br>
                This argument claims that there are many degrees of perfection, of goodness, of greatness, etc. As there
                are degrees of this, there must be one that has the most or highest degree. This argument is peculiar.
                Given that space is infinite, if we suppose that the degrees of perfection have a probability of
                occurring, even be it 10-100000, given that we have multiplied it by an infinite amount, it is necessary
                that each must occur. If then, space is infinite and variation is possible, a most perfect being must
                exist. But wait, the opposition may counter, space is infinite, but substance is not. Matter and energy
                are limited. This argument is not only unsubstantiated, but has interesting side effects. How then did
                the universe begin? Was the Big Bang an expenditure of energy? Perhaps it was merely potential energy
                converted into actual, but this raises yet more questions as to how potential was converted into actual
                without an actual. Gravity is an actual force; the potential energy of height is converted to actual
                kinetic energy by gravity.<br>
                But this entire thing is predicated on several assumptions: first, that a perfect being can exist;
                second, that we can describe the probability of such a being mathematically; third, that infinity is an
                adequate descriptor of space and is valid mathematically in tandem with a non-infinite number; fourth,
                that space is mathematically infinite; and fifth, that a being such as God can be empirically explained
                to arise within a system. Some of these things may be true, but I do not think that all of these things
                are fully satisfied. I dub this half of this argument inconclusive.<br>
                The second half of the argument claims more ontologically that the existence of degrees implies the full
                possible spectrum of degrees. This argument can be empirically noted to be at least partially wrong. I
                am taller than my brother. He is taller than my mother. We all are shorter than my roommate. There are
                degrees; yet, there is not a maximally tall person. No one is 12 or more feet tall, let alone 18, 50, or
                3000. It may be stated that this is too specific, for there are entities that are 12, 18, 50, 3000, or
                100,000,000 feet tall or more. Yet this brings into the question of how specific can something be?
                Perhaps human intelligence is too specific, but intelligence is not. Perhaps human dimension is too
                specific but dimension (space) is not. This section of argument may be valid, but it depends on the
                assumption that there are things which by existing in variable states implies the existence of maximal
                and minimal states, and on the further assumption that only some things must have this trait, while
                specific traits may be excluded. I think this argument may be valid when extrapolated further, but such
                extrapolation would require significant new arguments not present in the works of Aquinas.<br><br>

                <b>Aquinas' Final Cause Argument</b><br>
                The final cause argument: things in the world act for an end or purpose, but only an intelligent being
                can direct itself towards a purpose, so there must be an intelligent being that directs things towards
                their purpose.<br>
                Praxeology is fully inline with the purposeful designation of intelligent beings. The difficulties arise
                in seeking to prove the first premise: that things in the world are acting towards a purpose.<br>
                Structuring the argument, we have:
                <br>Only an intelligent being can act towards a purpose.
                <br>Things in the world are directed or function towards a purpose.
                <br>An intelligent being must be directing things in the world towards that purpose.
                <br>The difficulty of honestly evaluating this argument arises in determining what is meant by purpose. This
                example becomes clearest in my mind when applied to biology, most specifically cellular biology. Take,
                for instance, cellular respiration. The process of cellular respiration clearly operates with purpose,
                being that of producing ATP for the function of the cell, and by extension, the entire organism. Several
                enzymes operate for the exclusive action of facilitating one small step of this process. These things
                have a clear function - to facilitate cellular respiration; but is this their purpose? It seems that
                perhaps our best functional definition will have to be “an intended goal.” The purpose of a vacuum, the
                intended goal of a vacuum, is to clean via vacuous force. So then, it would seem clear that there are
                indeed non-intelligent entities acting towards purpose, which, if our first premise is true, requires an
                intelligent director.<br>
                As an aside, one could argue that the apparent purpose of enzymes disproves the premise that only
                intelligence acts with purpose. This apparent empirical evidence, however, assumes the first premise
                false in order to qualify as evidence, for it presumes that there is nothing directing or behind the
                apparent purpose of these enzymes. If purpose does require intelligence, pointing out the lack of
                intelligence of the enzymes serves no purpose, for that is assumed by the argument; after all, it is
                that lack of intelligence of the enzymes that would be held as evidence of a directing intelligence.
                Thus, we cannot dismiss the question: is the first premise true?<br>
                It would seem so, for only intelligence can have intent. A boulder cannot intend to roll; it merely does
                when outside factors make it. In short, only intelligence can act, while all else can only be acted
                upon. Unfortunately, I haven't the time to properly consider all aspects of this argument. I leave that
                to you as someone potentially evaluating this argument.<br>
                This is the most interesting of Aquinas' Five Ways, in my opinion, or at least the way I interpret it is
                interesting. In my interpretation is evident my Austrian background. As I have said before, I am
                religious because of my firm beliefs in praxeology and philosophy, not the other way around.<br><br>

                <b>Anselm's Ontological Argument</b><br>
                This argument is also definitely an argument. It states that whatever is contained in a clear and
                distinct idea of a thing must be predicted of that thing; that the greatest possible being is one that
                is greater than all other beings. I can imagine a greatest being, a maximally great being. A being that
                exists in reality is greater than one that exists in imagination. Thus, a maximally great being exists
                in reality.<br>
                Originally, I shamed this argument, but I have since discovered that I was omitting the first premise
                from the argument, which drastically improves the strength of the argument. However, I will address the
                actual strengths this argument has elsewhere, and allow for this argument to fall flat as it typically
                does. This argument is about as unpersuasive as any argument I've ever heard.<br><br>

                <b>Gödel's Ontological Argument</b><br>
                Ok, being completely honest, I need this one explained to me. I really don't get it. This is some big
                brained stuff that my monkey cortex is not equipped for. I'll be citing other sources heavily because my
                own mind is not a fitting repository for this. I hadn't even heard of Gödel until after starting this
                essay. Here's wikipedia on it.<br>
                “The proof uses modal logic, which distinguishes between necessary truths and contingent truths. In the
                most common semantics for modal logic, many "possible worlds" are considered. A truth is necessary if it
                is true in all possible worlds. By contrast, if a statement happens to be true in our world, but is
                false in another world, then it is a contingent truth. A statement that is true in some world (not
                necessarily our own) is called a possible truth.<br>
                First, Gödel axiomatizes the notion of a "positive property": for each property φ, either φ or its
                negation -φ must be positive, but not both (axiom 2). If a positive property φ implies a property ψ in
                each possible world, then ψ is positive, too (axiom 1). Gödel then argues that each positive property is
                "possibly exemplified", i.e. applies at least to some object in some world (theorem 1). Defining an
                object to be Godlike if it has all positive properties (definition 1), and requiring that property to be
                positive itself (axiom 3), Gödel shows that in some possible world a Godlike object exists (theorem 2),
                called "God" in the following. Gödel proceeds to prove that a Godlike object exists in every possible
                world.<br>
                To this end, he defines essences: if x is an object in some world, then a property φ is said to be an
                essence of x if φ(x) is true in that world and if φ necessarily entails all other properties that x has
                in that world (definition 2). Requiring positive properties being positive in every possible world
                (axiom 4), Gödel can show that Godlikeness is an essence of a Godlike object (theorem 3). Now, x is said
                to exist necessarily if, for every essence φ of x, there is an element y with property φ in every
                possible world (definition 3). Axiom 5 requires necessary existence to be a positive property.
                Hence, it must follow from Godlikeness. Moreover, Godlikeness is an essence of God, since it entails all
                positive properties, and any non-positive property is the negation of some positive property, so God
                cannot have any non-positive properties. Since necessary existence is also a positive property (axiom
                5), it must be a property of every Godlike object, as every Godlike object has all the positive
                properties (definition 1). Since any Godlike object is necessarily existent, it follows that any Godlike
                object in one world is a Godlike object in all worlds, by the definition of necessary existence. Given
                the existence of a Godlike object in one world, proven above, we may conclude that there is a Godlike
                object in every possible world, as required (theorem 4).”<br>
                Uh, let's simplify this, and quick, since my brain is bleeding.<br>
                God is defined as a being that possesses all positive properties. A positive property is something that
                makes a being greater or better, such as omnipotence (all-powerful), omniscience (all-knowing), etc.
                If a property is positive, its negation is not positive. A positive property cannot be something like
                weakness or ignorance. Anything that's not a positive property is either neutral or negative.
                Being God-like is a positive property. If a being possesses all positive properties, that being is
                God-like. This is considered a positive thing.<br>
                Positive properties are compatible with each other. It's possible for all positive properties to exist
                in the same being at the same time. For example, being all-powerful doesn't contradict being
                all-knowing.<br>
                Necessary existence is a positive property. Existing necessarily, meaning it's impossible for you not to
                exist, is a positive trait. So, it's better to exist necessarily than to exist only by chance.
                The conceptual world is a world, occupying a different kind of existence.<br>
                If something is God-like, it necessarily exists. If a God-like being can exist, it must exist. This is
                because a God-like being would have the property of necessary existence, and if such a being can exist,
                it must exist in all possible worlds.<br>
                Conclusion: God exists. Since being God-like is possible (it doesn't lead to any contradictions and thus
                exists in the conceptual world), there must be a being that possesses all positive properties, including
                necessary existence in said conceptual world. As a necessary being exists in a world, it exists in all
                worlds. Therefore, God exists.<br>
                The issue arises at premise 6, I think. I don't understand why the possible existence of a necessary
                being translates to the required existence of a necessary being. Something is metaphysically necessary
                if it could not fail to be otherwise. Thus, P6 has stated that because it is possible for a God-like
                being to exist, a God-like being could not fail to exist.<br>
                As an update to this point: if something necessarily exists in a world, it necessarily exists in all
                worlds, including ours.<br>
                This is particularly hard to wrap one's head around as a necessary being is one that must exist, so in
                the statement that it is possible for a necessary being to exist, we have said that it is possible for a
                being that must exist to exist, ie, we have said that a being that must exist could exist, despite said
                being maybe having to exist. He might must exist, which is counterintuitive.<br>
                I conclude this section as I began it: Я не понимаю (I do not understand). My brain informs me that this argument is true and
                false at the same time.<br><br>

                <b>The Meinongian Argument</b><br>
                This one is also hard to wrap my head around. The argument is a distinction between categories of
                existence. To quote Bertrand Russell on this,
                “If you say that the golden mountain does not exist, it is obvious that there is something that you are
                saying that does not exist - namely the golden mountain; therefore the golden mountain must subsist in
                some shadowy Platonic realm of being, for otherwise your statement that the golden mountain does not
                exist would have no meaning.”<br>
                I think, then, that this argument is that that which is conceived exists in a different category of
                existence than others things. I can imagine a dragon, thus, the concept of a dragon exists.<br>
                So it's kind of just Anselm's argument again? I think? Never use Wikipedia for research purposes, this
                is your lesson.<br>
                Perplexity AI, my friends, Perplexity. The premises:<br>
                There are objects that have being but do not exist (nonexistent objects).<br>
                These nonexistent objects are independent of God and have objective properties.<br>
                God has the power to bestow existence on nonexistent objects.<br>
                The argument:<br>
                Among the nonexistent objects is a being with maximal greatness - that than which no greater can be
                conceived.<br>
                This maximally great being has the property of necessary existence, as this is greater than contingent
                existence.<br>
                A being with necessary existence must exist in all possible worlds, including the actual world.<br>
                <em>Here's my problem premise. Why is it that an object that has a property of necessary existence
                inside the class of nonexistent objects must then exist as well in the class of existing objects? I feel
                like I need to deep dive into what necessary existence is to begin to understand this.</em><br>
                Therefore, the maximally great being (God) exists.<br>
                Perplexity has also blessed me with several criticisms:<br>
                Ontological Inflation: It may lead to an explosion of nonexistent objects, potentially including
                infinite variations of every conceivable thing.<br>
                I think this isn't an issue because it only would prove maximally great beings, or beings which must be
                necessary, could exist.<br>
                Essential Properties: If all properties of created beings are essential, it could lead to the
                problematic conclusion that created beings are on par with God ontologically.<br>
                Conceptual Concerns: The distinction between "being" and "existence" that Meinongianism requires is
                philosophically contentious.<br>
                To be honest, this is another argument that requires more time and thought than I am willing to give it.
                What is being? What is a nonexistent object? What does any of this mean? I'll come back to this once I
                understand necessary existence.<br>
                I came back, and the answer is the same: Guh?<br><br>

                <b>Descartes' Trademark Argument</b><br>
                A simple argument, and thank heavens for that. This argument simply states that the fact that each
                person has an understanding of and a concept of God is proof that God exists. To quote Descartes, “that
                the mere fact that I exist and have within me an idea of a most perfect being, that is, God, provides a
                very clear proof that God indeed exists.” Expanded, the argument claims that given that every person has
                an idea of such a being, that such as God must exist. I don't know if this argument succeeds, merely
                because history may not support it. It seems that historically there have been those without an
                understanding or idea of this kind of God, but as we cannot actually vet this assumption, it will be
                argumentatively dropped. The more rational argument against it is that a universal idea of God does not
                prove that said God exists. This is true, I think. It is not a definitive proof. But it is a strong
                indicator. The counter argument from the theist defender of this argument is, why would man have a
                universal idea of God rather than anything else? For instance, suppose a man sees lightning, and tells
                his friend, “You know, what if there's actually a super powerful being that decided to create that
                bright flash and sound for no reason other than he was angry?” Would not the argument that there was a
                super powerful being in order to explain lightning require convincing of far more than just saying,
                “Well, it could be like the seasons, or the tide, or the day and night, or the wind, or anything else.”
                It seems to me that it would be rather difficult, to say the least, to convince each man of this being.
                This argument, again, is not a mathematical proof. It is not 2+2=4. However, outside of the realm of
                mathematics, just about no argument is. The a priori is notoriously difficult to prove, and has been
                noted, is near impossible to prove to a determined skeptic.<br><br>

                <b>Important Note on Skepticism</b><br>
                The question of God is like the question of other minds. Both are near impossible to prove to a
                determined skeptic. I cannot prove, deterministically, that your mind exists. However, you would find it
                a ridiculous claim that you and only you exist. This is due, likely, to your reason telling you that
                believing such an argument is pointless, but equally if not more likely that your intuition, which is
                itself evidence of reality, has told you that what you have heard is false. Intuition is not infallible,
                but it is certainly a useful and powerful tool. Intuition is the mechanic by which the human mind
                accepts arguments and evidence that are not “definitive” or “undeniable.” How do I know that other minds
                exist? Because my intuition insists that it must be so. I cannot logically prove that it must be so, but
                I trust my intuition above the lack of reason here. Reason defeats intuition, but a lack of reason is
                surely defeated by intuition. Intuition, it seems, is valid evidence when not contradicted by reason.
                It is rather common for individuals to employ skepticism in an internally contradictory fashion. Quite
                frequently will someone employ a double standard because the conclusion of one argument which they
                accept is one which they would like to accept, while the conclusion of another argument which they don't
                accept is one which they would not like to accept, despite both conclusions being equally as strong, or
                often even from the same premises. This ought to be avoided; it is almost certainly true, however, that
                each of us at this current moment is doing exactly this. We seek to become more consistent; complete
                coherence likely will not occur.<br><br>

                <b>Avicenna's Proof of the Truthful Argument</b><br>
                This argument was advanced by some Islamist you've never heard of a thousand years ago. The argument
                says that the entire set of contingent things must have a cause that is not contingent because otherwise
                it would be included in the set. Thus, there must be a necessary cause. This argument is unique from the
                First Cause in that it completely disallows infinite regress as each thing in the sequence of infinite
                regress falls into the set of contingent things which must have a necessary thing. Even if infinite
                regress were possible, which it seems it is not, despite attempts from some to prove that it is (if you
                want to see more on this, go really in depth into the Kalam Cosmological argument), it would not
                invalidate this argument. From here, we know that a necessary entity exists, but not whether that
                necessary entity is the Christian or Islamic God.<br>
                Avicenna then argued that the necessary existent must be unique, for contradiction would arise if more
                than one necessary entity existed. “If one postulates two necessary existents, A and B, a simplified
                version of the argument considers two possibilities: if A is distinct from B as a result of something
                implied from necessity of existence, then B would share it, too (being a necessary existent itself), and
                the two are not distinct after all. If, on the other hand, the distinction resulted from something not
                implied by necessity of existence, then this individuating factor will be a cause for A, and this means
                that A has a cause and is not a necessary existent after all. Avicenna argued that the necessary
                existent must be simple (not a composite) by a similar reductio strategy. If it were a composite, its
                internal parts would need a feature that distinguishes each from the others. The distinguishing feature
                cannot be solely derived from the parts' necessity of existence, because then they would both have the
                same feature and not be distinct: a contradiction. But it also cannot be accidental, or [be] requiring
                an outside cause, because this would contradict its necessity of existence.”<br>
                His derivation of each of the qualities of God are quite complex and go into extreme detail impossible
                for anyone not desiring to write a proper novel on the topic. I do not desire to do this. His
                conclusions were, essentially, that God is a being composed of all positives, although he did not state
                this, choosing to rather list several distinct attributes.<br>
                The issues of this argument are essentially the same as Aquinas' Necessary Being argument, but to its
                credit, it does make an argument. However, it quite clearly does manage to distinguish itself from a
                First Cause argument. The primary argument offered historically against this argument is that for God to
                create the universe, if that action is necessary, God cannot have free will, and thus is lacking an
                attribute required of God (for God must have free will, for choosing to act is greater than being
                determined to act); if that action is contingent, it must have been caused, and thus contradicts God as
                a necessary entity. I am rough on this argument, of course having only read summaries of the argument,
                and never having read it in its original Arabic. I personally do not see why God's free will would
                contradict God's necessary status. The answer to this dilemma would seem to just be that there can be
                multiple required facets of a necessary existent. If there must be a necessary existent, if it must have
                multiple separately necessary traits in order to exist, this argument would be logically valid.<br><br>

                <b>Note on Unfalsifiable Claims</b><br>
                What is an unfalsifiable claim? Broadly speaking, it is a claim which cannot be proven to be false. More
                strictly speaking, anything is unfalsifiable if it cannot be empirically tested or proven false. It is
                important to note that the falsifiability of a claim is irrelevant to whether the claim is true. For
                instance, the claim that “I could have acted differently than I did in the past,” is an unfalsifiable
                claim. Ignoring the issue of free will or determinism, this claim would be objectively true, yet cannot
                be proven to be true, as one cannot empirically test it. In fact, one cannot even rationally test it
                beyond a certain point. It is unfalsifiable, despite its obvious truth.<br><br>

                <b>Argument From Beauty</b><br>
                This argument is one that roughly states that the evident beauty in nature, art and music and even in
                more abstract areas like the elegance of the laws of physics or the elegant laws of mathematics is
                evidence of a creator deity who has arranged these things to be beautiful (aesthetically pleasing, or
                "good") and not ugly. The question is why we find these things beautiful? Are they pleasing because they
                were designed to be so, or do we find them pleasing because we developed to do so? The question is then
                why would man find something like a rock formation beautiful. It is no question why man finds woman
                beautiful or woman finds man, but I do not see why man would find a rock beautiful. This is another
                pointer argument, for me, for I have not endeavored to show why beauty would arise or would not arise
                from or from the lack of a God, nor have I encountered this argument in its full expanse to discuss it.<br><br>

                <b>Argument From Consciousness</b><br>
                This argument claims characteristics of human consciousness, such as qualia, cannot be explained by the
                physical mechanisms of the human body and brain, therefore asserting that there must be non-physical
                aspects to human consciousness. This is held as indirect evidence of God, given that notions about souls
                and the afterlife in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam would be consistent with such a claim.
                Unfortunately, as I am lacking in the materialistic understanding of the brain, I am not suitable to
                explore this argument. The question of how could several facets of the human mind be as they are is not
                one I have the knowledge to peruse. While I am familiar with the nature of reason, I am not familiar
                with cerebral structure beyond the most pure basic level. I will have to leave this argument on the
                chopping block.<br><br>

                <b>The Teleological Argument</b><br>
                The teleological argument also known as physico-theological argument, argument from design, or
                intelligent design argument, is a rational argument for the existence of God or, more generally, that
                complex functionality in the natural world, which looks designed, is evidence of an intelligent creator.
                I will lump intelligent design and fine tuning together for this argument.<br>
                This argument is the argument requiring the most time and effort to display in its entire capacity. The
                complexity of this argument is thus that the fundamental mathematics and laws of reality must be
                examined piecemeal and combined, usually ending in a probabilistic argument from each variable.
                As this argument is so broad in scope, I will summarize the argument as I have concluded. It seems to me
                that the world is most surely probabilistic beyond pure chance. There are two main distinctions here:
                fine tuning and personally fine tuned. The first means that something is highly precise and specific,
                leading to the second, which is the conclusion that this high specificity was intentional and planned.
                The first seems objectively true. From this, the second intuitively follows, but the second is not
                logically required, merely extraordinarily likely.<br>
                The most typical rebuttal to this is the puddle analogy. It states that water cannot remark as to the
                nature of its container, as water fits its container. This argument falls flat as soon as one considers
                that life is not water. Life cannot become malleable to its circumstances like water can - there are
                many requirements for life, and we cannot merely assume that they could be different. Consider a God of
                the Gaps argument: it points to a hole in human understanding, and proposes an answer for this hole,
                treating the hole as proof for the hypothesis. The puddle is a Science of the Gaps argument. It claims
                that a hole is possible, and thus uses said hypothetically possible but entirely unsubstantiated hole as
                evidence to disprove the logical conclusion of human understanding. It is even less valid than a God of
                the Gaps argument.<br>
                The puddle fails yet again when we consider that the water fitting the hole has no bearing whatsoever on
                how remarkable the shape of the hole is. Saying that water fits the hole does not mean I cannot draw
                conclusions from the shape and nature of the hole. Suppose 50 men in a firing squad move to fire upon
                one person. Every single gun misfires. The puddle defender, to be consistent, would have to say that
                nothing can be concluded from this outcome. It happened a certain way, and thus, as it could have been
                otherwise, how it did happen is irrelevant. The rational mind, however, sees this as foolish. The
                potential for alternative outcomes does not mean there is not a reason why we achieved our particular
                outcome. To the deterministic mind, this argument becomes even worse, since things must have occurred as
                they did, and what does it say if the only possible outcome is this one?<br>
                The next most common rebuttal is that of multiverse theory. This argument is another Science of the Gaps
                like unto the puddle, but perhaps even worse of an argument. This argument, as with the puddle, claims
                that it is possible for another state of affairs to exist. Note that it is not pointing to a potential
                hole this time, but merely claiming that things beyond, rather than lacking, in human understanding are
                possible. Having then asserted that it could be the state of affairs for a multiverse to exist, it is
                then asserted that the existence of this unsubstantiated possibility (quite literally unsubstantiated,
                there is no evidence nor reason to believe this claim) disproves the conclusion drawn from actual and
                definitive affairs of our own world. It points to a possible point and concludes that this point is
                itself evidence against points which are not merely possible, but actual.<br>
                The only argumentatively valid critique of the Teleological Argument which has stood up to my critique
                has been the point that the circumstances of the universe, however improbable and unique, do not prove
                that a designer, or more specifically, that God, has designed them. This point is logically true. Thus I
                return to my Note of Skepticism. You may logically reject the Teleological Argument on this basis, but I
                find it unreasonable to do so. It seems to me that unless you desire to be a complete skeptic, you will
                almost certainly fall into a double standard and internal contradiction by rejecting this argument.
                The intelligent design half of the teleological argument, now, is more subjective. Why is there such
                order in the world? On the other hand, do we find the world to be ordered because we live in it? I am of
                the opinion that it makes no sense why I, a human, find rocks, mathematics, abstract concepts, and more,
                to be ordered or beautiful. I do not think that merely because I am living in this world means I must
                find meaning, order, and beauty from it. I think these things are indicative of something more, but once
                again, I classify this specific half of the argument as a pointer argument.<br><br>

                <b>Huxley's Argument From Psychedelics</b><br>
                Yes, this is an argument. The argument is that when one does drugs, the barriers preventing the human
                mind from perceiving reality drop, and one can perceive God. It's uhh, an argument, I'm pretty sure. It
                says something that the most well known proponent of this argument is Aldous Huxley, the author of Brave
                New World.<br>
                In order to pretend that this is a serious paper, I will pretend to seriously analyze this argument.
                This argument would claim that the results of drugs potentially giving one a religious experience is
                proof of God. This is also proof of dragons, tigers, and every possible thing experienced during a
                psychedelic trip. This argument falls flat, as it is far more likely that the drug trip has no bearing
                on reality, and if anything, is far from it. While I will not make the claim that anyone who believes
                this argument is lacking mental capacity, I will make the claim that anyone who believes in theism
                because of this argument is lacking mental capacity.<br><br>

                <b>Plantinga's Argument From Sensus Divinitatis</b><br>
                This argument posits that humans are born with an innate sense, or cognitive mechanism, that grants them
                awareness of God's presence. Alvin Plantinga argues that if beliefs formed by sensory experience can be
                considered properly basic, requiring no external justification, then beliefs in theism formed by a
                sensus divinitatis (a sense of the divine) can be considered properly basic as well, and thus require no
                external justification. Research in the cognitive science of religion suggests that the human brain has
                a natural and evolutionary predisposition towards theistic beliefs, which Kelly James Clark argues is
                empirical evidence for the presence of a sensus divinitatis.<br>
                Essentially, this argument is the argument that there is no need to prove the existence of God
                externally beyond the sense or feeling of the divine. Such an example would be, “I felt God's love, so I
                know he's real.” Note that this argument is typically accepted as valid by atheists, with the dispute in
                question being whether or not what is felt is indeed God's love. There is no question that there is
                feeling; to claim that each person who has had a religious experience is lying or faking it is patently
                ridiculous, far more so than would be the claim that no one is lying or faking it. However, what is
                being felt? A common rebuttal to this argument refers to such feelings as “chemicals in the brain” in
                order to debunk this argument. I find this rebuttal lacking, given that no one disputes that chemicals
                are present in the brain. This argument is essentially the same as arguing that reason isn't real, since
                there are merely electrical impulses traveling from synapse to synapse. This argument, if invalid, is a
                pointless objection, and if valid, convinces me further to oppose it. This rebuttal is rather foolish,
                and misses the mark entirely. It is not to be questioned that chemicals are present, but why those
                chemicals are present. As with all science versus religion false dichotomies, to point at a scientific
                explanation as an argument to disprove God presumes that God does not exist, for if God does exist, he
                has designed the world along these scientific lines. The question of whether something can be
                empirically proven is irrelevant to the question of whether it has been designed.<br>
                Sensus Divinitatis, however, falls into the personal experience hole: that of entirely valid for one
                person only, or perhaps for any who stake their beliefs on the words of others. If you take the stance
                that whatever I say is true, my own religious experience would be convincing to you. If you take the far
                more reasonable stance that I can be wrong, my own experience may or may not be convincing depending on
                how trustworthy you think my statement can be. The fact that I may conclude that something was personal
                proof of God may be convincing to you or not, but what is indisputable is that if you decide that my
                experience is not sufficient evidence for you, it is entirely logically coherent to do so.
                However, if you do accept this argument, you cannot logically critique someone who believes on the
                premise of personal experience. You simply are under no obligation to believe them or believe their
                conclusions.<br><br>


                <b>Hinman's Rational Warrant</b><br>
                Joseph Hinman, instead of attempting to prove the existence of God, argues you can "demonstrate the
                rationally-warranted nature of belief". Hinman uses a wide range of studies, including ones by Robert
                Wuthnow, Andrew Greeley, Mathes and Kathleen Nobel to establish that mystical experiences are
                life-transformative in a way that is significant, positive and lasting. He draws on additional work to
                add several additional major points to his argument. First, the people who have these experiences not
                only do not exhibit traditional signs of mental illness but, often, are in better mental and physical
                health than the general population due to the experience. Second, the experiences work. In other words,
                they provide a framework for navigating life that is useful and effective. All of the evidence of the
                positive effects of the experience upon people's lives he, adapting a term from Derrida, terms "the
                trace of God": the footprints left behind that point to the impact. Finally, he discusses how both
                religious experience and belief in God is, and has always been, normative among humans: people do not
                need to prove the existence of God. If there is no need to prove, Hinman argues, and the Trace of God
                (for instance, the impact of mystical experiences on them), belief in God is rationally warranted.
                I'll leave this one pretty much as is. I think it is succinct and clear enough that my commentary is
                unnecessary.<br><br>

                <b>Lewis' Argument From Desire</b><br>
                Briefly and roughly, the argument states that humans' natural desire for eternal happiness must be
                capable of satisfaction, because all natural desires are capable of satisfaction. C. S. Lewis, in Mere
                Christianity and elsewhere, posed that all natural desires have a natural object. One thirsts, and there
                exists water to quench this thirst; One hungers, and there exists food to satisfy this hunger. He then
                argued that the human desire for perfect justice, perfect peace, perfect happiness, and other
                intangibles strongly implies the existence of such things, though they seem unattainable on earth. He
                further posited that the unquenchable desires of this life strongly imply that we are intended for a
                different life, necessarily governed by a God who can provide the desired intangibles.<br>
                I am more fond of this argument than of many others. Like the trademark argument, it is an intuitive and
                interesting argument to consider, even if one decides it is incorrect. Like the question of why anyone
                would believe in a God if one doesn't exist, the question of why I would desire something that I cannot
                have is engaging and fun. A counter argument may claim that I can desire the ability to fly like how
                Superman can. I would counter that this is not a true desire, which I would characterize as a
                praxeological desire. I do not truly desire to fly like Superman, but it would surely be useful and
                cool. It is not something legitimately considered to be an option. Preference reflects reality, not
                imagination.<br><br>

                <b>Craig's Argument From Mathematics</b><br>
                The argument from mathematics is presented by American philosopher William Lane Craig. In the philosophy
                of mathematics, the ontological status of mathematical entities, such as numbers, sets, and functions is
                debated. Within this philosophical context, two primary positions emerge: mathematical realism and
                mathematical anti-realism. Realists argue that mathematical objects exist independently of human thought
                as abstract, non-causal entities. In contrast, anti-realists deny the independent existence of these
                mathematical objects. A pivotal issue in this debate is the phenomenon that physicist Eugene Wigner
                termed "the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics." This refers to the ability of mathematics to
                describe and predict phenomena in the natural world, exemplified by theoretical physicist Peter Higgs'
                use of mathematical equations to predict the existence of a fundamental particle, which was verified
                experimentally decades later.<br>
                Craig posits that this effectiveness presents a significant philosophical question about the
                applicability of mathematics, regardless of one's stance on the existence of mathematical entities. He
                argues that theism provides a more compelling framework for understanding this phenomenon than
                metaphysical naturalism. Under realism, non-theistic perspectives might view the alignment of
                mathematical abstractions with physical reality as a mere coincidence. However, a theistic realist might
                argue that this alignment is intentional, as a Supreme Being created the world based on these abstract
                mathematical structures. On the other hand, anti-realists, particularly those of a naturalistic
                persuasion, see mathematical relationships as reflections of real-world interactions, without
                necessitating abstract entities. Yet, Craig challenges this view by questioning why the physical world
                inherently exhibits such complex mathematical patterns without an intentional design. In contrast, the
                theistic anti-realist has a straightforward explanation: the world reflects a complex mathematical
                structure because it was created by God following an abstract model. Thus, Craig concludes that theism
                offers a superior explanation for why mathematics applies so effectively to understanding and predicting
                the physical world.<br>
                The argument is essentially, that mathematics are distinct and real things, as if mathematics were not
                independent of human thought, they would not be as accurate as they are. Thus, we can reasonably
                conclude that mathematics are distinct and separate from human thought; thus the idea that man has
                discovered mathematics, not invented them. The question then posed by the defenders of this argument is
                why this is the case. The difficulty of this argument, I think, is the question of what mathematics are.
                If mathematics are reflections of reality (satisfying the condition that math be real), it is not only
                expected but required that mathematics reflect the world. This question becomes a question of why we see
                such order, such beauty, such meaning, in things seemingly mundane. I believe Einstein once said that
                you know when the equation you have found is correct because it will be beautiful. This argument, then,
                reflects back into intelligent design. I will leave it as is from there.<br><br>

                <b>Lewis' Argument from Reason</b><br>
                To quote Lewis,
                “One absolutely central inconsistency ruins [the naturalistic worldview].... The whole picture professes
                to depend on inferences from observed facts. Unless inference is valid, the whole picture disappears....
                [U]nless Reason is an absolute--all is in ruins. Yet those who ask me to believe this world picture also
                ask me to believe that Reason is simply the unforeseen and unintended by-product of mindless matter at
                one stage of its endless and aimless becoming. Here is flat contradiction. They ask me at the same
                moment to accept a conclusion and to discredit the only testimony on which that conclusion can be
                based.”<br>
                To attempt to make precise the argument:<br>
                No belief is rationally inferred if it can be fully explained in terms of nonrational causes.<br>
                Support: Reasoning requires insight into logical relations. A process of reasoning (P therefore Q) is
                rational only if the reasoner sees that Q follows from, or is supported by, P, and accepts Q on that
                basis. Thus, reasoning is trustworthy (or "valid", as Lewis sometimes says) only if it involves a
                special kind of causality, namely, rational insight into logical implication or evidential support. If a
                bit of reasoning can be fully explained by non rational causes, such as fibers firing in the brain or a
                bump on the head, then the reasoning is not-reliable, and cannot yield knowledge. Consider this example:
                Person A refuses to go near the neighbor's dog because he had a bad childhood experience with dogs.
                Person B refuses to go near the neighbor's dog because one month ago he saw it attack someone. Both have
                given a reason for staying away from the dog, but person A's reason is the result of nonrational causes,
                while person B has given an explanation for his behavior following from rational inference (animals
                exhibit patterns of behavior; these patterns are likely to be repeated; this dog has exhibited
                aggression towards someone who approached it; there is a good chance that the dog may exhibit the same
                behavior towards me if I approach it). Consider a second example: person A says that he is afraid to
                climb to the 8th story of a bank building because he and humans in general have a natural fear of
                heights resulting from the processes of evolution and natural selection. He has given an explanation of
                his fear, but since his fear results from non-rational causes (natural selection), his argument does not
                follow from logical inference.<br>
                If naturalism is true, then all beliefs can be fully explained in terms of nonrational causes.
                Support: Naturalism holds that nature is all that exists, and that all events in nature can in principle
                be explained without invoking supernatural or other non-natural causes. Standardly, naturalists claim
                that all events must have physical causes, and that human thoughts can ultimately be explained in terms
                of material causes or physical events (such as neurochemical events in the brain) that are nonrational.
                Therefore, if naturalism is true, then no belief is rationally inferred (from 1 and 2).<br>
                We have good reason to accept naturalism only if it can be rationally inferred from good evidence.<br>
                Therefore, there is not, and cannot be, good reason to accept naturalism.<br>
                In other words, if naturalism is true, reason must not be valid/true.<br>
                This is my favorite argument, personally. It is an argument fine tuned for me. I think others of similar
                persuasion to myself may also enjoy the nature of this argument, even if they disagree, merely for the
                similarities it has to other arguments, such as Hoppe's argumentation ethics. I won't endeavor to argue
                further for the argument, but I shall provide a totally legal link to the book Miracles by CS Lewis, in
                which he covers this argument, among other things. I would call it required reading for any Christian,
                and certainly fun reading for anyone else.<br>
                This is perhaps my favorite argument for the existence of God. It seems to me a valid and coherent
                argument, as well as being quite interesting and unique in deployment. It is fun to think and effective.
                You cannot reject reason with reason; thus, as rejecting Premise 1 necessitates rejecting reason, this
                argument seems irrefutable. I cannot here give counter arguments used by opponents of this argument, for
                I have never seen one, nor can I envision one that is functional whatsoever.<br><br>

                <b>Argument From Witness' Testimony</b><br>
                Arguments from testimony rely on the testimony or experience of witnesses, possibly embodying the
                propositions of a specific revealed religion. It is often argued that it is a principle of rationality
                that one should accept testimony unless there are strong reasons for not doing so.<br>
                It can be argued that a testimony should not be accepted unless there are strong reasons to do so as
                well. This argument is essentially an appeal to authority without even having authority, to say nothing
                of proper authority. As with the following argument here, this argument only begins to have any use when
                considering between branches of theism.<br><br>

                <b>Argument From Historical Events</b><br>
                This argument is essentially something such as, “Jesus claimed to be the Son of God, and was a moral and
                good person, and thus he must have been God.” These arguments are just appeals to authority, usually. I
                don't find this argument persuasive in its rough state. The only appealing version of this argument I
                have seen is Lewis' famous “Lord, Liar, or Lunatic” proposition. It would state that Jesus Christ, who
                claimed to be the Son of God, and was evidently martyred to that cause, must have been either a liar,
                not believing himself to be who he said he was (contradicted by his actions and willingness to die), a
                lunatic, believing himself to be a God yet being simply man (contradicted by his words and actions,
                reflecting that of an exceptionally wise and sane man), or have been Lord, he who he claimed to be.
                Lewis excepting, the subtype of this argument shown here is rather poor, I would think.<br>
                Now, we do have our second type of Arguments from Historical Events. The argument being that Jesus
                claimed to be the Son of God, the disciples claimed to have seen him risen from the dead, Mohammed
                claimed to be given visions from heaven, Joseph Smith claimed to have seen angels and more, and so on
                and so forth. Many of these claims contradict each other. The Quran and Book of Mormon cannot both be
                true, for they contradict, but both are claimed to be true. While we can very well analyze historical
                details and come to conclusions, I do not believe that these arguments at all are useful until, perhaps,
                the discussion of which kind of theism is true. That discussion is one I shall not dip my toes into, as
                the question was solely on theism itself.<br><br>

                <b>The Sincere Seeker's Argument</b><br>
                This argument posits that every individual who follows a formulaic path towards guidance, arrives at the
                same destination of conviction in the existence of God. It is then usually claimed that this apparent
                natural law for guidance and belief could only be consistent if the formula and supplication were being
                answered by the same Divine entity being addressed.<br>
                Now, if it is truly the case that every individual who sincerely attempts the same path towards guidance
                arrives at God, this would seem to be fairly good evidence for God's existence. The difficulty arises in
                that we cannot discern whether someone is actually sincere when seeking guidance, and in addition, if we
                cannot be certain as to the formula to be followed, then the result will not be the same. Thus, we must
                be able to justify precisely what is allowed in this formula in order for this argument to land, which
                is a lengthy and perhaps impossible process, especially given that we must begin from a stance of merely
                presuming the existence of God, and thus concluding from there that this argument can be correct. In
                addition, this argument is very easily dishonestly used, for one can merely claim that someone erred in
                sincerely following the path if the result was not desired. It seems impossible to nail down, and thus,
                even while quite possibly true, cannot be reasonably used. The application of this argument, which is a
                necessary part of this argument, cannot be proven.<br><br>


                <b>Jacobi's Perceivable Suprasensible</b><br>
                In Germany, the School of Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi taught that human reason is able to perceive the
                suprasensible. Jacobi distinguished three faculties: sense, reason, and understanding. Just as sense has
                immediate perception of the material, so has reason immediate perception of the immaterial, while the
                understanding brings these perceptions to a person's consciousness and unites them to one another. God's
                existence, then, cannot be proven (Jacobi, like Immanuel Kant, rejected the absolute value of the
                principle of causality), it must be felt by the mind.<br>
                I am in fact struggling to find resources on this. So uh, this is here.<br><br>


                <b>The Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism</b><br>
                This argument states that evolution could not give rise to the cognitive functions of man, or, often,
                that evolution could not explain life as we see it.<br>
                To rather briefly engage with this argument, take DNA. DNA is biological code, so to speak, that is read
                by enzymes, and then, by enzymes, more DNA is produced, including the very enzymes which read and
                produce DNA. This seems surely impossible to naturally occur; it is the chicken and the egg, for the DNA
                is produced by and contained by the very thing which it produces, read by that which produces that which
                reads it, etc. The circular nature of this is obvious. The question then becomes, could this naturally
                occur? As it currently is, certainly not. Is it then possible that something could have occurred in
                order to allow for this? I cannot see how. I am rather unversed in genetics and abiogenesis. In short, I
                do not know. I do not know if this argument is sound or unsound.<br><br>


                <b>Coming Full Circle</b><br>
                Finally, we return back to Personal Experience. In my own personal experience, it seems that this and
                only this persuades people of a God. Ask any atheist/agnostic, what would convince you of God's
                existence? The answer is almost invariably some form of “a verifiable miracle.” The difference arises,
                always, in what can be considered verifiable. I have experienced things I consider to be miracles in my
                life. You could very well ask me, “But sir, how do you know that you didn't imagine those things, or
                didn't hallucinate?” In the end, my answer must be, “I don't. But at some point, I must act. I cannot
                wait for surefire mathematical proof in everything, or I shall starve to death in my bedroom. I could be
                wrong. But the evidence seems to show that I am not.”<br>
                At some point, we have to decide to believe something with insufficient evidence. Any time someone
                insists that we must have definitive and total proof for something, they are being inconsistent, for the
                same points would require them to doubt the Holocaust, the positions of their own organs, the existence
                of other human beings, the nature of reality, and many other things. If we wish to act rationally, we
                must recognize that we will never eliminate uncertainty. Uncertainty is a requirement of our lives. The
                question, then, is whether or not you are consistent in your principles. On what grounds do you reject
                things? On what grounds do you accept things? Are they consistent? I have found that many people reject
                self-evident truth on grounds no stronger than that “it would inconvenience me if this is false.” Many
                people reject probable truth on grounds in which, being consistent, they would have to reject their own
                beliefs. No one is immune to this. Each man has his blindspots, it is true. But that does not mean you
                should be willing to stay in one.
