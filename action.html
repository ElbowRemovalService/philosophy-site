            <p>Praxeology, a term coined by the German economist Ludwig von Mises, is the study of human (or
                intelligent) action. Praxeology is the foundation of economics (the study of human exchange and
                interaction) as well as a large part of morality (how man should act). Praxeology can be rather simply
                explained.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Man acts. This principle is irrefutable, for to say that man doesn't act, you have acted.</li>
                <li>Man has preference. Certain things are liked more or less than others. This is subjectively
                    evaluated. I may prefer apples to oranges, and you may prefer oranges to apples. </li>
                <li>Man acts with purpose. All of man's actions have a goal in mind. These actions are designed to
                    realize his preference. This does not mean his actions are a rational method of realizing
                    preference. </li>
                <li>Inaction is a form of action. If you choose not to decide, you have still made a choice.</li>

            <p>Morality is the primary concern of man's action in most people's minds. Firstly, it is considered what
                morality is. There are three primary positions: First, that morality does not exist. As morality is
                merely how man should act (and it is a given that man will act), this stance can be immediately
                discarded, for we know that man has preference, and man's actions have differing outcomes. The second
                position is that morality is subjective, differing from either person to person or culture to culture.
                This stance falls for the same error as subjective or relative epistemology (as outlined in <a
                    href="epistemology.html">Epistemology</a>). Thus, it may be discounted. Finally, we reach the third
                primary position: that morality is objective. This must be our stance. As for what is moral and what
                isn't is a much longer discussion.</p>
